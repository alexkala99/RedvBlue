# RedvBlue

Our configuration to reconstruct a red team vs blue team scenario from scratch.

In the grounds of our semester project at Aalborg University (campus Copenhagen), we built a network where there exist two teams and benign users. The red team is already in the network and tries to exploit vulnerabilities of the benign users' PCs. The blue team has configured their monitoring server to be listening to the entire network, logging traffic and raising alerts for attacks.

With the help of our professor and supervisor Sajad Homayoun, we brainstormed ideas on how the end result would look like. This repo has all files and a guide you can use to reconstruct our setup and run the custom made scenarios. Additionally, under the MIT License, you may add your own changes to this work and redistribute it.

Our entire setup relies on the use of open source tools and frameworks to make it reproducible. As of today, June 26th 2025, the current versions of these allow the project to take place without issues.
